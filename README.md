# Stock-Prediction
This project uses Markov chains - implemented as nested dictionaries in Python - to model the behavior of stocks.

The project can't be run locally because it relies on a module not available outside of 
the specific environment we ran in the class. However, all output is included within the notebook "stock_predict.ipynb".

To run the project, go to https://rice.codeskulptor.org.
