# Stock-Prediction
This project uses Markov chains - implemented as nested dictionaries in Python - to model the behavior of stocks.

The project can't be run locally because it relies on a module not available outside of 
the specific environment we ran in the class. However, output graphs are included in the repository
and other output is included in the Jupyter notebook.

To run the project, go to "rice.codeskulptor.org".
