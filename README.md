# Stock-Prediction
This was an in class project where we used Markov chains to model the behavior of stocks.

Unfortunately, the project can't be run because it relies on a module not available outside of 
the specific environment we ran in the class. However, the graphs are included in the repository
and the output is included in the Jupyter notebook.
