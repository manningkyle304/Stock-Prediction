    "\n",
    "We will use a Markov chain as a statistical model of a stock's performance. We will determine the likelihood that a stock will go up or down by building this model from the history of the stock's behavior. Modeling stock market performance is a difficult and important problem. We will only be scratching the surface of what is possible. While we will be able to get reasonably accurate predictions, you should not run off and start investing your money based on the results of this project!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite difficult to predict the exact price fluctuations of a stock from day to day. Instead we will try to predict how large the change will be. Given $P_i$, the price on day $i$, and $P_{i+1}$, the price on day $i+1$, we will consider $ \\delta_{i+1}= (P_i+P_{i+1})\\ / \\ P_i $ to be the change in price from day $i$ to day $i+1$. Using our model, we will try to predict in which of the following four ranges $\\delta_{i+1}$ will lie:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{cases}(-\\infty, -0.01)\\ \\text{(larger than 1% decrease)}\\\\\n",
    "[-0.01,0)\\\\\n",
    "[0,0.01)\\\\\n",
    "[0.01,\\infty)\\ \\text{ (larger than 1% increase)}\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will represent these four \"bins\" with the numbers $0$ through $3$, respectively, as indicated in the list above. I.e., bin $2$ is $[0,0.01)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this prediction, we will construct an $n^{th}$ order Markov chain using the history of these changes for $2$ years for each of two stocks, Google (GOOG) and First Solar Inc. (FSLR), and a stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)."
